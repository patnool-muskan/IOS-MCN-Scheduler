# Prerequisites

The hardware on which we have tried this tutorial:

|Hardware (CPU,RAM)                        |Operating System (kernel)                       |NIC (Vendor,Driver,Firmware)             |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
|Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6544Y 32-Core, 128GB|Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS (5.15.0-1038-realtime)       |Intel E810 ,ice, 4.00 0x8001184e 1.3236.0|
|Intel(R) i9-12700k 24-Core, 32GB          |Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS (5.15.0-1033-realtime)       |Intel XXV710 DA2T   6.02 0x80003888      |

**NOTE**: 

- These are not minimum hardware requirements. This is the configuration of our servers. 
- The NIC card should support hardware PTP time stamping. 
- If you are using Intel servers then use only Ice Lake or newer generations. 
- If you try on any other server apart from the above listed, then choose a desktop/server with clock speed higher than 3.0 GHz and `avx512` capabilities. 

NICs we have tested so far:

|Vendor         |Firmware Version        |
|---------------|------------------------|
|Intel E810-XXV |4.00 0x8001184e 1.3236.0|
|E810-C         |4.20 0x8001784e 22.0.9  |
|Intel XXV710   |6.02 0x80003888         |

**S-Plane synchronization is mandatory.** S-plane support is done via `ptp4l` and `phc2sys`. Make sure your version matches. 

| Software  | Software Version |
|-----------|------------------|
| `ptp4l`   | 3.1.1            |
| `phc2sys` | 3.1.1            |

We have verified LLS-C1 and LLS-C3 configuration in our lab, i.e.  using an external grandmaster, a switch as a boundary clock, and the gNB/DU and RU.  We haven't
tested any RU without S-plane. Radio units we are testing/integrating:

|Vendor           |Software Version      |
|-----------------|----------------------|
|VVDN LPRU        |03-v3.0.5             |
|Lekha  RU        |30014.T114S00.0500    |
|Lekha  RU        |30014.T114S00.0200    |

Tested libxran releases:

| Vendor                                  |
|-----------------------------------------|
| `oran_e_maintenance_release_v1.0`       |


**Note**: The libxran driver of the Distributed Unit identifies the above E release version as "5.1.0" (E is fifth letter, then 1.0), and the above F release as "6.1.0".

## Configure your server

1. Disable Hyperthreading (HT) in your BIOS. If run with HT make sure to pin the threads on alternate cores, to provide a dedicated physical CPU for timing sensitive threads.
2. We recommend you to start with a fresh installation of OS (Ubuntu). You have to install realtime kernel on your OS (Operating System). Based on your OS you can search how to install realtime kernel.
3. Install realtime kernel for your OS
4. Change the boot commands based on the below section. They can be performed either via `tuned` or via manually building the kernel

### CPU allocation

**This section is important to read, regardless of the operating system you are using.**

Your server could be:

* One NUMA node (See [one NUMA node example](#111-one-numa-node)): all the processors are sharing a single memory system.
* Two NUMA nodes (see [two NUMA nodes example](#112-two-numa-node)): processors are grouped in 2 memory systems.
  - Usually the even (ie `0,2,4,...`) CPUs are on the 1st socket
  - And the odd (ie (`1,3,5,...`) CPUs are on the 2nd socket

DPDK, Distributed Unit and kernel threads require to be properly allocated to extract maximum real-time performance for your use case.

1. **NOTE**: Currently the default Distributed Unit 7.2 configuration file requires isolated **CPUs 0,2,4** for DPDK/libXRAN, **CPU 6** for `ru_thread`, **CPU 8** for `L1_rx_thread` and **CPU 10** for `L1_tx_thread`. It is preferrable to have all these threads on the same socket.
2. Allocating CPUs to the Distributed Unit nr-softmodem is done using the `--thread-pool` option. Allocating 4 CPUs is the minimal configuration but we recommend to allocate at least **8** CPUs. And they can be on a different socket as the DPDK threads.
3. And to avoid kernel preempting these allocated CPUs, it is better to force the kernel to use un-allocated CPUs.

Let summarize for example on a `32-CPU` single NUMA node system, regardless of the number of sockets:

|Applicative Threads|Allocated CPUs    |
|-------------------|------------------|
|XRAN DPDK usage    |0,2,4             |
|`ru_thread`        |6                 |
|`L1_rx_thread`     |8                 |
|`L1_tx_thread`     |10                |
|`nr-softmodem`     |1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15|
|kernel             |16-31             |

In below example we have shown the output of `/proc/cmdline` for two different servers, each of them have different number of NUMA nodes. **Be careful in isolating the CPUs in your environment.** Apart from CPU allocation there are additional parameters which are important to be present in your boot command.

Modifying the `linux` command line usually requires to edit string `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` in `/etc/default/grub`, run a `grub` command and reboot the server.

* Set parameters `isolcpus`, `nohz_full` and `rcu_nocbs` with the list of CPUs to isolate for XRAN.
* Set parameter `kthread_cpus` with the list of CPUs to isolate for kernel.

Set the `tuned` profile to `realtime`. If the `tuned-adm` command is not installed then you have to install it. When choosing this profile you have to mention the isolated cpus in `/etc/tuned/realtime-variables.conf`. By default this profile adds `skew_tick=1 isolcpus=managed_irq,domain,<cpu-you-choose> intel_pstate=disable nosoftlockup` in the boot command. **Make sure you don't add them while changing `/etc/default/grub`**.

```bash
tuned-adm profile realtime
```

**Checkout anyway the examples below.**

### One NUMA Node

### Common

Configure your servers to maximum performance mode either via OS or in BIOS. If you want to disable CPU sleep state via OS then use the below command:

```bash
# to disable
sudo cpupower idle-set -D 0
#to enable
sudo cpupower idle-set -E
```

The above information we have gathered either from O-RAN documents or via our own experiments. In case you would like to read the O-RAN documents then here are the links:

1. [O-RAN-SC O-DU Setup Configuration](https://docs.o-ran-sc.org/projects/o-ran-sc-o-du-phy/en/latest/Setup-Configuration_fh.html)
2. [O-RAN Cloud Platform Reference Designs 2.0,O-RAN.WG6.CLOUD-REF-v02.00,February 2021](https://orandownloadsweb.azurewebsites.net/specifications)


## PTP configuration

**Note**: You may run the Distributed Unit with O-RAN 7.2 Fronthaul without a RU attached (e.g. for benchmarking).
In such case, you can skip PTP configuration and go to DPDK section.

1. You can install `linuxptp` debian package or from source by using [Helper scripts](../scripts/). It will install ptp4l and phc2sys.

```bash
#Ubuntu
sudo apt install linuxptp -y
```
or 
```bash
cd ./scripts
sudo ./setup_linuxptp.sh
```

Once installed you can use this configuration file for ptp4l (`/etc/ptp4l.conf`). Here the clock domain is 24 so you can adjust it according to your PTP GM clock domain

```
[global]
domainNumber            24
slaveOnly               1
time_stamping           hardware
tx_timestamp_timeout    1
logging_level           6
summary_interval        0
#priority1               127

[your_PTP_ENABLED_NIC]
network_transport       L2
hybrid_e2e              0
```

You need to increase `tx_timestamp_timeout` to 50 or 100 for Intel E-810. You will see that in the logs of ptp.

Create the configuration file for ptp4l (`/etc/sysconfig/ptp4l`)

```
OPTIONS="-f /etc/ptp4l.conf"
```

Create the configuration file for phc2sys (`/etc/sysconfig/phc2sys`)

```
OPTIONS="-a -r -r -n 24"
```

The service of ptp4l (`/usr/lib/systemd/system/ptp4l.service`) should be configured as below:

```
[Unit]
Description=Precision Time Protocol (PTP) service
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
EnvironmentFile=-/etc/sysconfig/ptp4l
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/ptp4l $OPTIONS

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

and service of phc2sys (`/usr/lib/systemd/system/phc2sys.service`) should be configured as below:

```
[Unit]
Description=Synchronize system clock or PTP hardware clock (PHC)
After=ntpdate.service ptp4l.service

[Service]
Type=simple
EnvironmentFile=-/etc/sysconfig/phc2sys
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/phc2sys $OPTIONS

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### Debugging PTP issues

You can see these steps in case your ptp logs have erorrs or `rms` reported in `ptp4l` logs is more than 100ms.
Beware that PTP issues may show up only when running RAN and XRAN. If you are using the `ptp4l` service, have a look back in time in the journal: `journalctl -u ptp4l.service -S <hours>:<minutes>:<seconds>`

1. Make sure that you have `skew_tick=1` in `/proc/cmdline`
2. For Intel E-810 cards set `tx_timestamp_timeout` to 50 or 100 if there are errors in ptp4l logs
3. Other time sources than PTP, such as NTP or chrony timesources, should be disabled. Make sure they are enabled as further below.
4. Make sure you set `kthread_cpus=<cpu_list>` in `/proc/cmdline`.
5. If `rms` or `delay` in `ptp4l` or `offset` in `phc2sys` logs remain high then you can try pinning the `ptp4l` and `phc2sys` processes to an isolated CPU.

```bash
#to check there is NTP enabled or not
timedatectl | grep NTP
#to disable
timedatectl set-ntp false
```
# Configuration

RU and DU configurations have a circular dependency: you have to configure DU MAC address in the RU configuration and the RU MAC address, VLAN and Timing advance parameters in the DU configuration.

**Note**: You may run the Distributed Unit with O-RAN 7.2 Fronthaul without a RU attached (e.g. for benchmarking).
In such case, skip RU configuration and only configure Network Interfaces, DPDK VFs and the Distributed Unit configuration by using arbitrary values for RU MAC addresses and VLAN tags.

## Configure the RU

Contact the RU vendor and get the configuration manual to understand the below commands. The below configuration only corresponds to the RU firmware version indicated at the start of this document. If your firmware version does not correspond to the indicated version, then please don't try these commands.

**NOTE**: Please understand all the changes you are doing at the RU, especially if you are manipulating anything related to output power. 

### VVDN LPRU

**Version 3.x**

The configuration file [`gnb-du.sa.band78.273PRB.2x2-f1-e1-vvdn_gen3.iisc.conf`](../conf/gnb-du.sa.band78.273PRB.2x2-f1-e1-vvdn_gen3.iisc.conf) corresponds to:
- TDD pattern `DDDDDDSUUU`, 5ms
- Bandwidth 100MHz
- MTU **8870**

### RU configuration

Check in the RU user manual how to configure the center frequency. There are multiple ways to do it. We set the center frequency by editing `sysrepocfg` database. You can use `sysrepocfg --edit=vi -d running` to do the same. You can edit the `startup` database to make the center frequency change persistent. 

To make any change in the RU, always wait for it to be PTP synced. You can check the sync status via `tail -f /var/log/synctimingptp2.log`.

To set the RU for 2TX and 2RX antennas with no compression, you need to create this XML file and apply it. 

Login to the ru and create this file as `2x2-config.xml`.

```xml
<vvdn_config>
    <du_mac_address>YOUR-DU-MAC-ADDR</du_mac_address>
    <cu_plane_vlan>YOUR-RU-VLAN</cu_plane_vlan>  
    <prach_layer0_PCID>2</prach_layer0_PCID>
    <prach_layer1_PCID>3</prach_layer1_PCID>
    <prach_layer2_PCID>6</prach_layer2_PCID>
    <prach_layer3_PCID>7</prach_layer3_PCID>
    <pxsch_layer0_PCID>0</pxsch_layer0_PCID>
    <pxsch_layer1_PCID>1</pxsch_layer1_PCID>
    <pxsch_layer2_PCID>4</pxsch_layer2_PCID>
    <pxsch_layer3_PCID>5</pxsch_layer3_PCID>
</vvdn_config>
```
Execute the below commands on every restart

```bash
xml_parser 2x2-config.xml
## This will show the current configuration
/etc/scripts/lpru_configuration.sh
## Edit the sysrepo to ACTIVATE the carrier when you want to use the RU
## option 1 - activation by writing directly in register
mw.l a0050010 <YOUR-RU-VLAN>3 # e.g. VLAN = 4 => `mw.l a0050010 43`
## option 2 - activation via sysrepocfg command
sysrepocfg --edit=vi -d running
```

## Configure Network Interfaces and DPDK VFs

The 7.2 fronthaul uses the xran library, which requires DPDK. In this step, we
need to configure network interfaces to send data to the RU, and configure DPDK
to bind to the corresponding PCI interfaces. More specifically, in the
following we use [SR-IOV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-root_input/output_virtualization)
to create one or multiple virtual functions (VFs) through which Control plane (C
plane) and User plane (U plane) traffic will flow. The following commands are
not persistant, and have to be repeated after reboot.

In the following, we will use these short hands:

- `IF_NAME`: Physical network interface through which you can access the RU
- `VLAN`: the VLAN tag as recommended by the RU vendor
- `MTU`: the MTU as specified by the RU vendor, and supported by the NIC
- `DU_U_PLANE_MAC_ADD`: DU U plane MAC address
- `U_PLANE_PCI_BUS_ADD`: PCI bus address of the VF for U plane
- `DU_C_PLANE_MAC_ADD`: DU C plane MAC address
- `C_PLANE_PCI_BUS_ADD`: PCI bus address of the VF for C plane

In the configuration file, in option `fhi_72.dpdk_devices`, the first PCI address is for U-plane and the second for C-plane.

RU might support either one DU MAC address for both CU planes or two different.
i.e. VVDN Gen3, Metanoia support only one, Benetel550 supports both cases


**Note**

- X710 NIC supports the same DU MAC address for multiple VFs
- E-810 NIC requires different DU MAC addresses for multiple VFs

If the RU vendor requires untagged traffic, remove the VLAN tagging
in the below command and configure VLAN on the switch as "access VLAN". In case
the MTU is different than 1500, you have to update the MTU on the switch
interface as well.

### Set maximum ring buffers:

As a first step, please set up the maximum allowed buffer size to your desired interface. To check the maximum value, please execute the following command:
```bash
sudo ethtool -g $IF_NAME
```

```bash
set -x
IF_NAME=<YOUR_PHYSICAL_INTERFACE_NAME>
MAX_RING_BUFFER_SIZE=<YOUR_PHYSICAL_INTERFACE_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE>

sudo ethtool -G $IF_NAME rx $MAX_RING_BUFFER_SIZE tx $MAX_RING_BUFFER_SIZE
```

### Set the maximum MTU in the physical interface:
```bash
set -x
IF_NAME=<YOUR_PHYSICAL_INTERFACE_NAME>
MTU=<RU_MTU>

sudo ip link set $IF_NAME mtu $MTU
```

### (Re-)create VF(s)

#### one VF

```bash
set -x
IF_NAME=<YOUR_PHYSICAL_INTERFACE_NAME>
DU_CU_PLANE_MAC_ADD=<YOUR_DU_CU_PLANE_MAC_ADDRESS>
VLAN=<RU_VLAN>
MTU=<RU_MTU>

sudo modprobe iavf
sudo sh -c 'echo 0 > /sys/class/net/$IF_NAME/device/sriov_numvfs'
sudo sh -c 'echo 1 > /sys/class/net/$IF_NAME/device/sriov_numvfs'
sudo ip link set $IF_NAME vf 0 mac $DU_CU_PLANE_MAC_ADD vlan $VLAN mtu $MTU spoofchk off # set CU planes PCI address
```

#### two VFs

```bash
set -x
IF_NAME=<YOUR_PHYSICAL_INTERFACE_NAME>
DU_U_PLANE_MAC_ADD=<YOUR_DU_U_PLANE_MAC_ADDRESS>
DU_C_PLANE_MAC_ADD=<YOUR_DU_C_PLANE_MAC_ADDRESS> # can be same as for U plane -> depends if the NIC supports the same MAC address
VLAN=<RU_VLAN>
MTU=<RU_MTU>

sudo modprobe iavf
sudo sh -c 'echo 0 > /sys/class/net/$IF_NAME/device/sriov_numvfs'
sudo sh -c 'echo 2 > /sys/class/net/$IF_NAME/device/sriov_numvfs'
sudo ip link set $IF_NAME vf 0 mac $DU_U_PLANE_MAC_ADD vlan $VLAN mtu $MTU spoofchk off # set U plane PCI address
sudo ip link set $IF_NAME vf 1 mac $DU_C_PLANE_MAC_ADD vlan $VLAN mtu $MTU spoofchk off # set C plane PCI address
```

After running the above commands, the kernel created VF(s) that
have been assigned a PCI address under the same device and vendor ID. For
instance, use `sudo lshw -c network -businfo` to get a list of PCI addresses
and interface names, locate the PCI address of `$IF_NAME`, then use
`lspci | grep Virtual` to get all virtual interfaces and use the ones with the
same Device/Vendor ID parts (first two numbers).

<details>
<summary>Example with two VFs</summary>

The machine in this example has an Intel X710 card. The interface
<physical-interface> in question is `eno12409`. Running `lshw` gives:

```bash
$ sudo lshw -c network -businfo
Bus info          Device     Class          Description
=======================================================
[...]
pci@0000:31:00.1  eno12409   network        Ethernet Controller X710 for 10GbE SFP+
[...]
```

We see the PCI address `31:00.1`. Listing the virtual interfaces through
`lspci`, we get

```bash
$ lspci | grep Virtual
31:06.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation Ethernet Virtual Function 700 Series (rev 02)
31:06.1 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation Ethernet Virtual Function 700 Series (rev 02)

98:11.4 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation Ethernet Adaptive Virtual Function (rev 02)
98:11.5 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation Ethernet Adaptive Virtual Function (rev 02)
```

The hardware card `31:00.1` has two associated virtual functions `31:06.0` and
`31:06.1`.
</details>

### Bind VF(s)

Now, unbind any pre-existing DPDK devices, load the "Virtual Function I/O"
driver `vfio_pci` or `mlx5_core`, and bind DPDK to these devices.

#### Bind one VF

```bash
set -x
CU_PLANE_PCI_BUS_ADD=<YOUR_CU_PLANE_PCI_BUS_ADDRESS>
DRIVER=<YOUR_DRIVER> # set to `vfio_pci` or `mlx5_core`, depending on your NIC

sudo /usr/local/bin/dpdk-devbind.py --unbind $CU_PLANE_PCI_BUS_ADD
sudo modprobe $DRIVER
sudo /usr/local/bin/dpdk-devbind.py --bind $DRIVER $CU_PLANE_PCI_BUS_ADD
```

#### Bind two VFs

```bash
set -x
U_PLANE_PCI_BUS_ADD=<YOUR_U_PLANE_PCI_BUS_ADDRESS>
C_PLANE_PCI_BUS_ADD=<YOUR_C_PLANE_PCI_BUS_ADDRESS>
DRIVER=<YOUR_DRIVER> # set to `vfio_pci` or `mlx5_core`, depending on your NIC

sudo /usr/local/bin/dpdk-devbind.py --unbind $U_PLANE_PCI_BUS_ADD
sudo /usr/local/bin/dpdk-devbind.py --unbind $C_PLANE_PCI_BUS_ADD
sudo modprobe $DRIVER
sudo /usr/local/bin/dpdk-devbind.py --bind $DRIVER $U_PLANE_PCI_BUS_ADD
sudo /usr/local/bin/dpdk-devbind.py --bind $DRIVER $C_PLANE_PCI_BUS_ADD
```

We recommand to put the above four steps into one script file to quickly repeat them.

## Configure the DU

**Beware in the following section to let in the range of isolated cores the parameters that should be (i.e. `L1s.L1_rx_thread_core`, `L1s.L1_tx_thread_core`, `RUs.ru_thread_core`, `fhi_72.io_core` and `fhi_72.worker_cores`)**

Edit the sample DU configuration file and check following parameters:

* `gNBs` section
  * The PLMN section shall match the one defined in the CU.
  * `prach_ConfigurationIndex`
  * `prach_msg1_FrequencyStart`
  * Adjust the frequency, bandwidth and SSB position

* `L1s` section
  * Set an isolated core for L1 thread `L1_rx_thread_core`, in our environment we are using CPU 8
  * Set an isolated core for L1 thread `L1_tx_thread_core`, in our environment we are using CPU 10
  * `phase_compensation` should be set to 0 to disable when it is performed in the RU and set to 1 when it should be performed on the DU side
  * `tx_amp_backoff_dB` controls the output level of the Distributed Unit with respect to a full-scale output. The exact value for `tx_amp_backoff_dB` should be obtained from the O-RU documentation. This documentation typically includes detailed sections on Downlink (DL) signal scaling and gain setup. **Warning:** Exceeding the recommended power limits may permanently damage the RU.

* `RUs` section
  * Set an isolated core for RU thread `ru_thread_core`, in our environment we are using CPU 6

* `fhi_72` (FrontHaul Interface) section: this config follows the structure
  that is employed by the xRAN library (`xran_fh_init` and `xran_fh_config`
  structs in the code):
  * `dpdk_devices`: PCI addresses of NIC VFs binded to the DPDK (not the physical NIC but the VFs, use `lspci | grep Virtual`) in the format `{VF-U-plane, VF-C-plane}`;
    if one VF used per RU, U and C planes will share the same VF => depends on the RU capabilities
  * `system_core`: absolute CPU core ID for DPDK control threads, it should be an isolated core, in our environment we are using CPU 0
    (`rte_mp_handle`, `eal-intr-thread`, `iavf-event-thread`)
  * `io_core`: absolute CPU core ID for XRAN library, it should be an isolated core, in our environment we are using CPU 4
  * `worker_cores`: array of absolute CPU core IDs for XRAN library, they should be isolated cores, in our environment we are using CPU 2
  * `ru_addr`: RU U- and C-plane MAC-addresses (format `UU:VV:WW:XX:YY:ZZ`, hexadecimal numbers)
  * `mtu`: Maximum Transmission Unit for the RU, specified by RU vendor; either 1500 or 9600 B (Jumbo Frames); if not set, 1500 is used
  * `file_prefix` : used to specify a unique prefix for shared memory and files created by multiple DPDK processes; if not set, default value of `wls_0` is used
  * `dpdk_mem_size`: the huge page size that should be pre-allocated by DPDK
    _for NUMA node 0_; by default, this is 8192 MiB (corresponding to 8 huge
    pages à 1024 MiB each, see above). In the current implementation, you
    cannot preallocate memory on NUMA nodes other than 0; in this case, set
    this to 0 (no pre-allocation) and so that DPDK will allocate it on-demand
    on the right NUMA node.
  * `dpdk_iova_mode`: Specifies DPDK IO Virtual Address (IOVA) mode:
    * `PA`: IOVA as Physical Address (PA) mode, where DPDK IOVA memory layout
      corresponds directly to the physical memory layout.
    * `VA`: IOVA as Virtual Address (VA) mode, where DPDK IOVA addresses do not
      follow the physical memory layout. Uses IOMMU to remap physical memory.
      Requires kernel support and IOMMU for address translation.
    * If not specified, default value of "PA" is used (for backwards compabilibity;
      it was hardcoded to PA in the past). However, we recommend using "VA" mode
      as it offers several benefits. For a detailed explanation of DPDK IOVA,
      including the advantages and disadvantages of each mode, refer to
      [Memory in DPDK](https://www.dpdk.org/memory-in-dpdk-part-2-deep-dive-into-iova/)
  * `owdm_enable`: used for eCPRI One-Way Delay Measurements; it depends if the RU supports it; if not set to 1 (enabled), default value is 0 (disabled)
  * `fh_config`: parameters that need to match RU parameters
    * timing parameters (starting with `T`) depend on the RU: `Tadv_cp_dl` is a
      single number, the rest pairs of numbers `(x, y)` specifying minimum and
      maximum delays
    * `ru_config`: RU-specific configuration:
      * `iq_width`: Width of DL/UL IQ samples: if 16, no compression, if <16, applies
        compression
      * `iq_width_prach`: Width of PRACH IQ samples: if 16, no compression, if <16, applies
        compression
    * `prach_config`: PRACH-specific configuration
      * `eAxC_offset`:  PRACH antenna offset; if not set, default value of `N = max(Nrx,Ntx)` is used
      * `kbar`: the PRACH guard interval, provided in RU

Layer mapping (eAxC offsets) happens as follows:
- For PUSCH/PDSCH, the layers are mapped to `[0,1,...,Nrx-1]/[0,1,...,Ntx-1]` where `Nrx/Ntx` is the
  respective RX/TX number of antennas.
- For PRACH, the layers are mapped to `[No,No+1,...No+Nrx-1]` where `No` is the
  `fhi_72.fh_config.[0].prach_config.eAxC_offset`. xran assumes PRACH offset `No >= max(Nrx,Ntx)`.
  However, we made a workaround that xran supports PRACH eAxC IDs same as PUSCH eAxC IDs. This is achieved with `is_prach` and `filter_id` parameters in the patch.
  Please note that this approach only applies to the RUs that support this functionality, e.g. LITEON RU.

**Note**

- At the moment, the Distributed Unit is compatible with CAT A O-RU only. Therefore, SRS is not supported.
- XRAN retreives DU MAC address with `rte_eth_macaddr_get()` function. Hence, `fhi_72.du_addr` parameter is not taken into account.

# Start and Operation of the Distributed Unit(DU)

Run the `nr-softmodem`:
```bash
sudo nr-softmodem -O <DU configuration file> --thread-pool <list of non isolated cpus>
```

**Warning**: Make sure that the configuration file you add after the `-O` option is adapted to your machine, especially to its isolated cores.

You have to set the thread pool option to non-isolated CPUs, since the thread
pool is used for L1 processing which should not interfere with DPDK threads.
For example if you have two NUMA nodes in your system (for example 18 CPUs per
socket) and odd cores are non-isolated, then you can put the thread-pool on
`1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15`. On the other hand, if you have one NUMA node, you can use
either isolated cores or non isolated cores, but make sure that isolated cores
are not the ones defined earlier for DPDK/xran.

<details>
<summary>Once the gNB runs, you should see counters for PDSCH/PUSCH/PRACH per
antenna port, as follows (4x2 configuration):</summary>

```
[NR_PHY]   [o-du 0][rx   24604 pps   24520 kbps  455611][tx  126652 pps  126092 kbps 2250645][Total Msgs_Rcvd 24604]
[NR_PHY]   [o_du0][pusch0   10766 prach0    1536]
[NR_PHY]   [o_du0][pusch1   10766 prach1    1536]
```

</details>

The first line show RX/TX packet counters, i.e., packets received from the RU
(RX), and sent to the RU (TX). In the second and third line, it shows the
counters for the PUSCH and PRACH ports (2 receive antennas, so two counters
each). These numbers should be equal, otherwise it indicates that you don't
receive enough packets on either port.

<details>
<summary>If you see many zeroes, then it means that the Distributed Unit does not receive
packets on the fronthaul from the RU (RX is almost 0, all PUSCH/PRACH counters
are 0).</summary>

```
[NR_PHY]   [o-du 0][rx       2 pps       0 kbps       0][tx 1020100 pps  127488 kbps 4717971][Total Msgs_Rcvd 2]
[NR_PHY]   [o_du0][pusch0       0 prach0       0]
[NR_PHY]   [o_du0][pusch1       0 prach1       0]
```

</details>

In this case, please make sure that the O-RU has been configured with the right
ethernet address of the gNB, and has been activated. You might enable port
mirroring at your switch to capture the fronthaul packets: check that you see
(1) packets at all (2) they have the right ethernet address (3) the right VLAN
tag. Although we did not test this, you might make use of the [DPDK packet
capture feature](https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/howto/packet_capture_framework.html)

<details>
<summary>If you see messages about `Received time doesn't correspond to the
time we think it is` or `Jump in frame counter`, the S-plane is not working.</summary>

```
[PHY]   Received Time doesn't correspond to the time we think it is (slot mismatch, received 480.5, expected 475.8)
[PHY]   Received Time doesn't correspond to the time we think it is (frame mismatch, 480.5 , expected 475.5)
[PHY]   Jump in frame counter last_frame 480 => 519, slot 19
[PHY]   Received Time doesn't correspond to the time we think it is (slot mismatch, received 519.19, expected 480.12)
[PHY]   Received Time doesn't correspond to the time we think it is (frame mismatch, 519.19 , expected 480.19)
[PHY]   Received Time doesn't correspond to the time we think it is (slot mismatch, received 520.1, expected 520.0)
```

You can see that the frame numbers jump around, by 5-40 frames (corresponding
to 50-400ms!). This indicates the gNB receives packets on the fronthaul that
don't match its internal time, and the synchronization between gNB and RU is
not working!

</details>

In this case, you should reverify that `ptp4l` and `phc2sys` are working, e.g.,
do not do any jumps (during the last hour). While an occasional jump is not
necessarily problematic for the gNB, many such messages mean that the system is
not working, and UEs might not be able to attach or reach good performance.
Also, you can try to compile with polling (see [the build
section](.#build-oai-gnb)) to see if it resolves the problem.
